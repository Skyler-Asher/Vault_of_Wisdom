1. **Knowing when to turn off the charts:** It is vital to stop trading once you have secured a win for the day, especially in the early phases of your career. Instead of staying addicted to the screen, you should take that win and study it to build pattern recognition for what you are doing correctly. Conversely, if you take a loss, you must avoid the urge to chase it, as doing so often leads to losing double the amount or blowing your account. 
 
2. **Journaling:** You cannot improve without data to show what you did right on wins and wrong on losses. By maintaining a journal—whether through a digital platform or pen and paper—you can identify specific patterns, such as realizing you consistently lose money on certain types of trades and deciding to remove those from your strategy. 

3. **Stop jumping from strategy to strategy:** Most strategies found online can be profitable; the failure usually lies in the trader's **psychology and risk management**. You must accept that no strategy has a 100% win rate and that losing trades are an inherent part of the process, much like a professional basketball player missing a shot. 

4. **Patience and discipline:** Trading is a skill that takes a long time to master, similar to learning the piano, and is not a "get rich quick" scheme. You must be patient enough to allow the skill set to grow and disciplined enough to avoid trading out of desperation to pay immediate bills. 
   
5. **Have a trading plan:** Entering the market without a plan is effectively "planning to fail". A functional plan must include two specific components: a **strategy** that dictates when you enter a trade and a **risk management plan** that defines how much you are willing to risk. 

6. **Risk management is everything:** Even with a high win rate, risking your entire account on a single trade will eventually lead to a "squad wipe" where your balance is gone. Proper risk management allows you to sustain losses without significantly decreasing your balance, keeping you on an **exponential growth curve** over the long term.
