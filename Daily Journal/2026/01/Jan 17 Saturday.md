3 Things that i want to accomplish today 

1 --- I want to have a proper exercise session 
2 --- In my Trading i want to create a rule that give me clarity in identifying my internal and external structure   
3 ---  Store the wisdom of J.D Rockefeller inside the mentors , and at the end of day read the mentors

1. After  A External BOS  , price continues to increase  until we have internal Trend Change  thus giving us our External Weak high , now we have range having a strong low and a weak high establishing bullish market 
   
2. For A weak high/low  to be confirmed on a  ,we are looking for an  internal Trend change that has occurred after the previous weak high/low has been violated .  
   
   
   This theory is wrong as internal and external structure sometimes overlap but this theory just block that
