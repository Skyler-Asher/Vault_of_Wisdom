Create an educational video based on the provided news article.


Start the video with a clean title screen that clearly displays:
• Article Title - (Extract it from the source )  
• Author Name  - (Extract it from the source )
• Publish Date  -(Extract it from the source )
** Mention Verbally ** 


After the title screen, 

present a short **Roadmap** so viewers know what to expect. The Roadmap must include:
 **Big Picture:** 
 
1. One-sentence summary: State who is buying/merging with whom, deal type, price or structure, and the immediate outcome.
    
2. Background: Briefly profile both parties, recent triggers, and the market or regulatory setting enabling the deal.
    
3. Key terms: Define 3–6 essential mechanics (consideration, earnout, approvals, break fees) in one line each.
    
4. Core developments: Explain structure, valuation, strategy, financing, and key conditions or timelines.
    
5. Impact: Outline short- and medium-term effects on shareholders, employees, customers, competitors, and risks.
    
6. Recap: One closing sentence plus three takeaways—strategic significance, main risk, and next milestone to watch.

Narration Requirements:
- Use very simple, clear sentences suitable for someone with zero prior knowledge.
- Maintain a speaking pace of **130–140 words per minute**.
- Keep sentences short and avoid jargon.

Complex Terms Rule:
Explain ideas using a Tiered Clarity approach. Before using any technical term, identify its level and explain it once in plain language. For foundational terms, give a very brief definition. For institutions or tools, define them and state their role. For advanced mechanisms, define them and show a simple cause-and-effect. For rare or article-specific terms, define once, then reuse briefly. Never place multiple unexplained terms in one sentence—slow down and explain first. Always prioritize clarity over precision so the explanation remains easy to follow.

Visual Style:
Use minimal text, clean graphics, and helpful icons. Highlight definitions on screen when they appear.

Target length: **6–8 minutes**.  
Tone: neutral, informative, and easy to follow.
