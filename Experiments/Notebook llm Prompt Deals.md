- Avoid jargon whenever possible.

### Complex Terms Rule

Use a **Tiered Clarity approach**:

- Before using any technical term, identify its level and explain it once in plain language.
    
- For foundational terms, give a short and simple definition.
    
- For institutions or financial tools, explain what they are and their role.
    
- For advanced mechanisms, explain the definition and show a simple cause-and-effect example.
    
- For rare or article-specific terms, define them once clearly, then reuse them briefly afterward.
    

Do not place multiple unexplained terms in one sentence.  
Slow down and explain first.  
Always prioritize clarity over precision.
