Create an educational video based on the provided news article.

Start the video with a clean title screen that clearly displays:
• Article Title  
• Author Name  
• Publish Date  
** Mention Verbally **

After the title screen, present a short **Roadmap** so viewers know what to expect. The roadmap must include:
1. One-sentence summary of the article  
2. Important background or context  
3. Definitions of key terms  
4. Main arguments or developments  
5. Real-world impact or why it matters  
6. Final recap with 3 key takeaways  

Narration Requirements:
- Use very simple, clear sentences suitable for someone with zero prior knowledge.
- Maintain a speaking pace of **130–140 words per minute**.
- Keep sentences short and avoid jargon.

Complex Terms Rule:
Before using any technical word (for example: inflation, ECB, BOE, interest rates, GDP), briefly explain it in one sentence using plain language, then continue the explanation normally.

Visual Style:
Use minimal text, clean graphics, and helpful icons. Highlight definitions on screen when they appear.

Target length: **6–8 minutes**.  
Tone: neutral, informative, and easy to follow.
