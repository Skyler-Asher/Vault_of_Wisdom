just imagine every human out there can imagine something that happened to them or the future . 

that just means its  a superpower that let you simulate reality unlimited times , you can simulate different scenarios 


### Personal Observations -- 

I have noticed some Gr using these what if questions to get their answers 

like Alex hormozi said -- If my whole family life depends on getting jacked by the end of the year  what is it that i would do  . 


or like Elon_musk said -- what is it that my future 10 year self would do in this case . 


as we can both above are simulated realities that helps the mind to come up with better plans
