just imagine every human out there can imagine something that happened to them or the future . 

that just means its  a superpower that let you simulate reality unlimited times , you can simulate different scenarios 


### Personal Observations -- 

I have noticed successful people   using  what if questions to increase their thinking abilities. 

Alex Hormozi -- If my whole family life depends on getting jacked by the end of the year  what is it that i would do  . 

Elon Musk said -- what is it that my future 10 year self would do in this case . 

 Unknown_source -- What would you dream if there is a 100% chance that your dream will come true? 

*IN the above 3 cases , they all are what if scenarios or we call them imaginative scenarios . *
