Create an educational video based on the provided news article.

Begin the video with a clean title screen that clearly displays:

- **Article Title** (Extract from the source)
    
- **Author Name** (Extract from the source)
    
- **Publish Date** (Extract from the source)
    

These details must also be mentioned verbally in the narration.

---

After the title screen, present a short **Roadmap** so viewers understand what to expect.

The Roadmap must include:


- **Start with the Big Question** – What problem is the article talking about? Say it in one simple sentence.
    
- **Define Key Words** – Explain basic terms in plain language (e.g., inflation = prices rising over time).
    
- **Why It Matters** – Connect the issue to daily life: jobs, food prices, savings, business, or government.
    
- **Author’s Main Argument** – What is the writer trying to convince readers of?
    
- **Evidence Used** – Data, examples, expert opinions, or trends.
    
- **Opposing View** – Mention what critics might say.
    
- **Final Takeaway** – Summarize the core message in one clear sentence.

- Strategic significance
    
- Main risk
    
- Next milestone to watch

- Maintain a speaking pace of **130–140 words per minute**.
    
- Keep sentences short.
    
- Avoid jargon whenever possible.

### Complex Terms Rule

Use a **Tiered Clarity approach**:

- Before using any technical term, identify its level and explain it once in plain language.
    
- For foundational terms, give a short and simple definition.
    
- For institutions or financial tools, explain what they are and their role.
    
- For advanced mechanisms, explain the definition and show a simple cause-and-effect example.
    
- For rare or article-specific terms, define them once clearly, then reuse them briefly afterward.
    

Do not place multiple unexplained terms in one sentence.  
Slow down and explain first.  
Always prioritize clarity over precision.

### Visual Style

- Use minimal on-screen text.
    
- Use clean graphics.
    
- Add helpful icons.
    
- Highlight definitions on screen when they appear.
