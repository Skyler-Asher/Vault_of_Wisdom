Create an educational video based on the provided news article.


Start the video with a clean title screen that clearly displays:
• Article Title - (Extract it from the source )  
• Author Name  - (Extract it from the source )
• Publish Date  -(Extract it from the source )
** Mention Verbally ** 

After the title screen, 
present a short **Road-map** so viewers know what to expect. The Road-map must include:
1. One-sentence summary of the article  
2. Important background or context  
3. Definitions of key terms  
4. Main arguments or developments  
5. Real-world impact or why it matters  
6. Final recap with 3 key takeaways  

Narration Requirements:
- Use very simple, clear sentences suitable for someone with zero prior knowledge.
- Maintain a speaking pace of **130–140 words per minute**.
- Keep sentences short and avoid jargon.

Complex Terms Rule:
Explain ideas using a Tiered Clarity approach. Before using any technical term, identify its level and explain it once in plain language. For foundational terms, give a very brief definition. For institutions or tools, define them and state their role. For advanced mechanisms, define them and show a simple cause-and-effect. For rare or article-specific terms, define once, then reuse briefly. Never place multiple unexplained terms in one sentence—slow down and explain first. Always prioritize clarity over precision so the explanation remains easy to follow.

Visual Style:
Use minimal text, clean graphics, and helpful icons. Highlight definitions on screen when they appear.

Target length: **6–8 minutes**.  
Tone: neutral, informative, and easy to follow.
