Begin the video with a clean title screen that clearly displays:

- **Article Title** (Extract from the source)
    
- **Author Name** (Extract from the source)

These details must also be mentioned verbally in the narration.

After the title screen, present a short **Roadmap** so viewers understand what to expect.

The Roadmap must include:

Big Picture --  According to the Article 

1. **One-sentence summary:**  
    State who is buying or merging with whom, the deal type, the price or structure, and the immediate outcome.
    
2. **Background:**  
    Briefly profile both parties. Mention recent triggers and the market or regulatory environment that made this deal possible.
    
3. **Key Terms:**  
    Define 3–6 essential deal mechanics in one line each (for example: consideration, earnout, regulatory approval, break fee).
    
4. **Core Developments:**  
    Explain the structure, valuation, strategy, financing, key conditions, and timeline.
    
5. **Impact:**  
    Outline the short- and medium-term effects on shareholders, employees, customers, competitors, and potential risks.
    
6. **Recap:**  
    End with one closing sentence and three clear takeaways:

### Narration Requirements

- Use very simple and clear language suitable for someone with no prior knowledge.
    
- Maintain a speaking pace of **130–140 words per minute**.
    
- Keep sentences short.
    
- Avoid jargon whenever possible.

### Complex Terms Rule

Use a **Tiered Clarity approach**:

- Before using any technical term, identify its level and explain it once in plain language.
    
- For foundational terms, give a short and simple definition.
    
- For institutions or financial tools, explain what they are and their role.
    
- For advanced mechanisms, explain the definition and show a simple cause-and-effect example.
    
- For rare or article-specific terms, define them once clearly, then reuse them briefly afterward.
    

Do not place multiple unexplained terms in one sentence.  
Slow down and explain first.  
Always prioritize clarity over precision.

### Visual Style

- Use minimal on-screen text.
    
- Use clean graphics.
    
- Add helpful icons.
    
- Highlight definitions on screen when they appear.
