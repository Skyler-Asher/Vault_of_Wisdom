 **Big Picture:** What is happening in the economy and why it matters now.
    
- **Economic Context:** The larger forces driving the story (policy, inflation, growth, trade, etc.).
    
- **Key Terms Simplified:** Explain essential concepts in plain language.
    
- **Core Development:** What changed and the cause → effect behind it.
    
- **System Impact:** How it influences markets, businesses, consumers, and global flows.
    
- **Winners & Losers:** Who benefits, who faces pressure.
    
- **Looking Ahead:** What signals or data to watch next.

Narration Requirements:
- Use very simple, clear sentences suitable for someone with zero prior knowledge.
- Maintain a speaking pace of **130–140 words per minute**.
- Keep sentences short and avoid jargon.

Complex Terms Rule:
Explain ideas using a Tiered Clarity approach. Before using any technical term, identify its level and explain it once in plain language. For foundational terms, give a very brief definition. For institutions or tools, define them and state their role. For advanced mechanisms, define them and show a simple cause-and-effect. For rare or article-specific terms, define once, then reuse briefly. Never place multiple unexplained terms in one sentence—slow down and explain first. Always prioritize clarity over precision so the explanation remains easy to follow.

Visual Style:
Use minimal text, clean graphics, and helpful icons. Highlight definitions on screen when they appear.

Target length: **6–8 minutes**.  
Tone: neutral, informative, and easy to follow.
